## Overview
Developers have to write shell commands frequently but have few tools to orgnize "cleaned shell in-output". 

With the ShellRecorder, developers can record the shell commands and outputs as recording a video, edit it, save the cleaned ones as executable scripts or instructural examples and export it to forums. 

So, developers can easily manage the shell commands of locally reused applications, clearly indicate changes in command versions, and facilitate the dissemination of online teaching information.
